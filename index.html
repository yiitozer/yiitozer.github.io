<p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>

<p>Iâ€™m <strong>Yigitcan Ã–zer</strong>, a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://yamagishilab.jp/">Yamagishi Lab</a>, National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, Japan. I specialize in <strong>audio processing</strong>, with a focus on <strong>watermarking</strong> and <strong>generative models for speech and music</strong>.</p>

<p>After earning my B.Sc. from <a href="https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/">Bilkent University</a> (Turkey) and M.Sc. from the <a href="https://www.tum.de">Technical University of Munich</a> (Germany), I completed my Ph.D. at the <a href="https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de">International Audio Laboratories Erlangen</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/mueller">Prof. Meinard MÃ¼ller</a>. Before that, I worked at <a href="https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en.html">Fraunhofer IIS</a> as a research associate in the Spoken Language Processing Group.</p>

<p>During my Ph.D., I pursued a project deeply connected to my identity as a <strong>pianist</strong>. Iâ€™ve always dreamed of playing a piano concerto with an orchestra â€” but instead of waiting for that opportunity, I decided to create it myself. This led to my work on <strong>source separation of piano concertos</strong>, enabling me to extract orchestral parts from recordings and play alongside them. This journey resulted in a personally meaningful integration of science and art. One highlight was performing with Mozartâ€™s Piano Concerto in D minor using a custom orchestral backing generated as a final product of my Ph.D. You can explore the project and listen to further audio demos <a href="https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/PCD_AudioLabs">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before returning to research, I spent three years in industry. At an American startup in Munich, I worked on <strong>deep learning for computer vision</strong>, and later became an <strong>IT consultant</strong>, developing solutions in Python and C++ across various domains. In 2019, I rejoined academia through a research position at Fraunhofer IIS, contributing to <strong>text-to-speech synthesis</strong>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a self-declared <strong>language nerd</strong> who enjoys diving into <strong>etymology</strong> and steadily learning new languages. During my Ph.D., I also co-led workshops on <strong>electronic instrument design</strong> for high school students at <a href="https://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/en.html">Fraunhofer IDMT</a> in Ilmenau â€” blending outreach, music, and engineering.</p>
