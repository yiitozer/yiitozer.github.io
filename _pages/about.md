Welcome to my personal website!

I'm **Yigitcan Ã–zer**, a postdoctoral researcher at the [Yamagishi Lab](https://yamagishilab.jp/), National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, Japan. I specialize in **audio processing**, with a focus on **watermarking** and **generative models for speech and music**.

After earning my B.Sc. from [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) (Turkey) and M.Sc. from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de) (Germany), I completed my Ph.D. at the [International Audio Laboratories Erlangen](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de) under the supervision of [Prof. Meinard MÃ¼ller](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/mueller). Before that, I worked at [Fraunhofer IIS](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en.html) as a research associate in the Spoken Language Processing Group.

### ðŸŽ¶ Merging Music and Research

During my Ph.D., I pursued a project deeply connected to my identity as a **pianist**. Iâ€™ve always dreamed of playing a piano concerto with an orchestra â€” but instead of waiting for that opportunity, I decided to create it myself. This led to my work on **source separation of piano concertos**, enabling me to extract orchestral parts from recordings and play alongside them. This journey resulted in a personally meaningful integration of science and art. One highlight was performing with Mozartâ€™s Piano Concerto in D minor using a custom orchestral backing generated as a final product of my Ph.D.:

### ðŸ’» Industry Meets Academia

Before returning to research, I spent three years in industry. At an American startup in Munich, I worked on **deep learning for computer vision**, and later became an **IT consultant**, developing solutions in Python and C++ across various domains. In 2019, I rejoined academia through a research position at Fraunhofer IIS, contributing to **text-to-speech synthesis**.

### ðŸ§  Side Passions

I'm a self-declared **language nerd** who enjoys diving into **etymology** and steadily learning new languages. During my Ph.D., I also co-led workshops on **electronic instrument design** for high school students at [Fraunhofer IDMT](https://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in Ilmenau â€” blending outreach, music, and engineering.
